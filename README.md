# Bash Scripts

A curated collection of Bash scripts I use to automate and simplify everyday tasks. These scripts cover a variety of common system operations, productivity enhancements, and development utilities.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

Each script is stored in an individual file with comments to explain its purpose and usage. The structure is designed to be simple and easy to navigate.

## üîß Requirements

Most scripts are designed to run in a standard Unix-like environment with Bash. Some may depend on common tools like:

- `curl`
- `git`

Refer to individual script headers for specific requirements.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mvtt25/bash-scripts.git
   cd bash-scripts
   ```

2. Make a script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x script-name.sh
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./script-name.sh
   ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Always review a script before running it to ensure it behaves as expected in your environment.

## üìú Script Descriptions

Below is a list of available scripts and a short description of what each does (update this as your collection grows):
